Authors: Claudia Słaboń, Kateryna Kondratovych

Short description: The aim of this project is to predict the price of the used cars.

Data comes from:
https://www.kaggle.com/avikasliwal/used-cars-price-prediction.
Only file train-data.csv should be downloaded in order to reproduce the code.

Files:
- MLPresentation.pdf - short presentation which describes the problem, approaches and the result,
- Regression-project.ipynb - Python code,
- Regression-project.html - output in the HTML format.

Used algorithms:
- linear regression,
- K Nearest Neighbours (KNN) with Manhatan and Euclidean metrics,
- Support Vector Regression (SVM)

Results: The best algoritm has been choosen based on the lowest Mean squared error (MSE) and highest R-squared coefficient.
Due to that KNN algorithm with 25 nearest neighbours and Manhatan metric has been choosen.
